# Rename

Rename is a CLI written in Rust, that accepts a csv data file and a directory of images and renames all files in that directory according to a pattern, based on the respective row in the data file.

The rule by which to rename the file is hardcoded, since any no more flexibility is required and the landscape of possibilities for looser coupling is too great.
